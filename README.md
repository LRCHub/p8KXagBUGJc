[00:07.21] I hate the silence now that you're not here
[00:12.94] I thought one day you'd come around
[00:17.62] Am I livin' in the past with all these questions, never asked?
[00:23.78] Will they keep me here?
[00:35.28] 
[00:31.32] It's so quiet in the stratosphere
[00:36.86] I keep my space, but I'm still bound
[00:41.79] To the spell that we both cast
[00:44.04] But sometimes, magic doesn't last
[00:47.89] For me, it did
[00:50.75] For me, it did
[00:57.75] 
[00:53.96] I
[00:55.41] Played out this scene
[00:58.59] Of you with each other
[01:01.57] But not that with me
[01:04.59] That kind of love
[01:07.52] Is so hard to see
[01:10.90] Now, here we are
[01:16.72] It's him that you need
[01:19.89] Looks just like us
[01:22.76] Us without me
[01:29.26] 
[01:30.93] Why do I fade into that heart of yours?
[01:36.63] 'Cause you still hold a spot in mine
[01:42.25] But you're in someone else's room
[01:44.60] While mine still smells of your perfume
[01:47.41] I'm tethered
[01:50.65] Forever
[01:54.15] 
[01:53.61] I
[01:55.54] Played out this scene
[01:58.62] Of you with each other
[02:01.37] But not that with me
[02:04.31] And that kind of love
[02:07.34] Is so hard to see
[02:10.63] Now, here we are
[02:16.34] It's him that you need
[02:19.42] Looks just like us
[02:22.34] Us without me
[02:28.84] 
[02:29.09] Ooh, oh oh oh
[02:35.61] Without me
[02:41.38] Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:50.38] 
[02:46.88] Oh, I've
[02:49.66] Played out this scene
[02:52.25] Of you with each other
[02:55.30] But not that with me
[02:58.24] And that kind of love
[03:01.61] Is so hard to see
[03:04.70] Now, here we are
[03:10.85] It's him that you need
[03:13.92] Looks just like us
[03:16.92] Us without me
